# Data-Mining-Comparison-of-Methods



I investigated how different data mining methods (artificial neural networks,support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests) performed in classifying between malignant and benign tumors using the UCI Breast Cancer Diagnosis (Wisconsin) Dataset. This project was the first time I had utilized performance measures and tools such as the F score and ROC curves in data mining/ML classification, so it was a good experience to improve my understanding.
